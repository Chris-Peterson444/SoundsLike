# Project code for LIN205A Project -- UC Davis, Spring 2022

## Running the LSTM classifier
There is a Google Colab [demonstration notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RM6Y7uKIeVWdsWw0gJSILo-97LD-otgS?usp=sharing) on how to run inference using our final models

There is also a [training notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QNJtLb5mmAX36C4MUMdfxM2krjMI1bc5?usp=sharing) where we demonstrate how we trained our models.
